# Russian A.I. Cup - codeball 2018

## todo
- ATK needs to be a bit more aggressive: get balls earlier in air
- DEF is now very vulnerable to lobs
- We shall try heuristics for trajectories with initial velocity:
  - option 1: superimpose old decaying linearly and new increasing linearly until target velocity reached
  - any idea
